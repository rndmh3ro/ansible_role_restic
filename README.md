 Description
-------------
[Restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) is a versatile Go based backup
solution which supports multiple backends, deduplication and incremental
backups.

This role installs restic on a client, configures the backup repositories
and optionally sets systemd timer or cronjobs to run the backups.
Aditionally, it will setup executable scripts to run a Backup manually.

> This Project borrowed heavily from the
> [donat-b/ansible-restic](https://github.com/donat-b/ansible-restic) and
> the [https://github.com/arillso/ansible.restic](https://github.com/arillso/ansible.restic)
> ansible role. We try to make this role more easy to anderstand and modern by using systemd timer,
> /etc/crontab to define backup paths, more absolute paths and less options. (no S3 Storage, No Windows...)

### Backup Scripts
This role will create a backup script and a file with credentials usable with the `source` command on linux for each backup in the `restic_script_dir`.
These executable scripts can be used to manually trigger a backup action, but
are also used for automated backups if you have set `restic_create_schedule` variable to true.
Make sure to not change the files manually, as this can interfere with your
backups quite a bit.

on Linux, if you want to take a manual snapshot, you can run the backup like this:
```bash
$ /path/to/backup/script/backup-example.sh
```
by default, such a snapshot will be given the tag `manual`, so you can distinguish
them from automatically created snapshots. You can also append more tags by
simply appending them:
```bash
$ /path/to/backup/script/backup-example.sh --tag deployment
```

### CRON / Scheduled Tasks
In order to make use of defined backups, they can be automatically setup as
scheduled tasks. You have to be aware of the fact that (on linux systems at
least) you need to have administrator permissions for configuring such an action.

If you cannot use the automatic creation of the tasks, you can still make use
of the generated scripts. If you are for example on a shared hosting server
and can define a cronjob via a webinterface, simply add each backup file to
be executed. Make sure to prefix the command with `CRON=true` to imply that the
snapshot was created via a scheduled task:
```bash
CRON=true /path/to/backup/script/backup-example.sh
```

### Repos
Restic stores data in repositories. You have to specify at least one repository
to be able to use this role. A repository can be local or remote (see the
official [documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html)).

> **Using an SFTP repository**
>
> For using an SFTP backend, the user needs passwordless access to the host.
> Please make sure to distribute ssh keys accordingly, as this is outside of
> the scope of this role.

| `disable_logging`  |           no                  | Optionally disable logging  |
| `mail_on_error`    |           no                  | Optionally send a mail if the backupjob will fail *(mailx is required)* |
| `mail_address`     |  if `mail_on_error` is true   | The mail addressto recive mails if you enabled ``mail_on_error``. |

Example:
```yaml
restic_backups:
  data:
    name: data
    repo: remove
    src: /path/to/data
    scheduled: true
    schedule_oncalendar: '*-*-* 01:00:00'
```

> You can also specify restic_backups as an array, which is a legacy feature and
> might be deprecated in the future. currently, the name key is used for
> namint the access and backup files

#### Exclude
the `exclude` key on a backup allows you to specify multiple files to exclude or
files to look for filenames to be excluded. You can specify the following keys:
```yaml
exclude:
    exclude_cache: true
    exclude:
        - /path/to/file
    iexclude:
        - /path/to/file
    exclude_file:
        - /path/to/file
    exclude_if_present:
        - /path/to/file
```
Please refer to the use of the specific keys to the
[documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/040_backup.html#excluding-files).
